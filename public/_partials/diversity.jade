    ffconf takes diversity seriously. We know that a diverse line-up is important for the inclusion of marginalised people in the tech community.

    We want people to attend because of the content we provide, not who's presenting it. As such, we only reveal our speakers at the day of the conference.

    This statement is our approach to make our commitment to diversity as transparent as possible. We are striving to do better each year.

    Last year, ffconf's speaker distribution included 50% women and this year we intend to maintain diversity in our speakers. And we are <abbr title="proudly"><span style="color:#f00;">p</span><span style="color:#ff7f00;">r</span><span style="color:#ff0;">o</span><span style="color:#0f0;">u</span><span style="color:#0ff;">d</span><span style="color:#00f;">l</span><span style="color:#8b00ff;">y</span></abbr> holding our event in Brighton.

    This isn't something we should be proud of, because it should be the norm, but it is what we've got and we'd like to share that with you.

    You can also apply for our [diversity scholarship](https://remysharp.com/2016/07/06/diversity-scholarships-2016), open until 9-September 2016.
