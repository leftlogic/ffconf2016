Having a performant site isn't just about getting things to load quickly with concatentation, minification, and the critical rendering path, it's also about responding to the user's input quickly and efficiently; it's about smooth scrolling and timely animations. Ultimately it's about getting pixels onto the user's screen quickly and keeping things fast.",

We will stop at every point in the pipeline to focus on what tools we have our disposal, what the common bottlenecks are, and how we can go about fixing them.\n\nTowards the end of the day you'll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to your own sites, and come away more confident of how to include performance and profiling in your day-to-day work.",
