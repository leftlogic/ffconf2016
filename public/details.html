<h1>Details for ffconf 2016</h1>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Please find below important and useful information to make sure your visit to our #ffconf on <em>either</em> Thursday 10th <em>or</em> Friday 11th November 2016 is a super dooper awesome time!</p>
<p>Please also hashtag all the things with <strong>#ffconf</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>How to get there: <a href="http://ffconf.org/directions">http://ffconf.org/directions</a></p>
<p>The conference is being held at the historic Duke of York&#39;s Picturehouse in Brighton. It is centrally located on Preston Circus, less than 15 minutes walk from Brighton train station. Trains run regularly from Gatwick Airport, London Bridge and London Victoria stations. We recommend using <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">http://www.traintimes.org.uk</a> for up to date timetables. Hotel recommendations can be found on our website: <a href="http://2016.ffconf.org/#locations">http://2016.ffconf.org/#locations</a></p>
<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>Registration opens at 9am and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp! There are no tickets for the conference, but you must bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up your delegate programme which also acts as your pass. Please keep your pass with you at all times as you will need it to get back into the conference.</p>
<p>Note that by attending any of our events - workshops &amp; conference, you are agreeing to our code of conduct: <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">http://confcodeofconduct.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns or questions, please contact a member of staff (wearing ffconf t-shirts) immediately. Or contact Julie directly on (+44) 7481 345941 by SMS (note: this number does not accept calls).</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>If you plan to bring a laptop, make sure it&#39;s fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful charging stations in the venue.</p>
<p>There is no wifi. I mean, it&#39;s a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s even been known that some people go classic old school and use a pen and paper! See: <a href="http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ">http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ</a> :)</p>
<h2 id="refreshments">Refreshments</h2>
<p>Tea, Coffee and Danishes will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. Please note lunch is not included but we have a few recommendations here: <a href="http://ffconf.org/food">http://ffconf.org/food</a></p>

<h2 id="after-party">After Party - both days</h2>
<p>Please join us at the After Party at Oh So Social from 6:15pm-late: <a href="http://ffconf.org/party">http://ffconf.org/party</a>  (bring your pass for entry). There&#39;ll be some food available to order until 8pm and free drinks vouchers on the door.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>same</strong> venue is being used for both days, and you're welcome to join both evenings (though drinks vouchers are only available to those with applicable day pass).</p>
<p>The venue is open to all ages, but those of you under 18 years old, we ask that you don&#39;t try to buy any alcoholic drinks or ask anyone else to ask on your behalf. You will also need to leave by 10pm as the venue doesn&#39;t have a license for under 18s beyond this time. All important, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be super awesome and play nice.</p>
<h2 id="pre-conference">Pre conference</h2>
